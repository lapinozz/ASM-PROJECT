# ASM-SFML

I wanted to make a game in Assembly and knew SFML so i decided to make it using CSFML

This is a "game"/circuit-simulator, you are given certain input and rule to follow and you have to build logic circuit using logic gate to output following the rules

In the campaign you will have to build CPU

What work:
	circuit
	view
	logic gate
	rotation of gate(half working)

Todo:	
	Currently it use mouse, it will make it simpler to develope(and even maybe to play) if it's keyboard-only
